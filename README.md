# Getting Started with Create React App

This is a very basic Wordle clone made in React in just a few days. 

# Future Improvements
- Fix logic with yellow spaces where the letter is in the word but was correctly guessed already.
- Use modals to display messages to players instead of alerts.
- Place the game elements in more components so that I can better utulize the grid and improve code readability.
- Further styling and visual upgrades.
